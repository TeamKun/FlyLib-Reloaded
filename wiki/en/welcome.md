# Welcome

FlyLib Reloaded is a utility library that supports plugin development for Minecraft Paper, making it very tedious and
buggy to create complex logic for displaying commands and their usage in Paper, and to create menus. FlyLib provides a
great solution to this problem.

Features now implemented:

- An easy and powerful command system.
- Menus that can be written in DSL format.
- Many useful extensions (You can also use it from Java, but it is more convenient from Kotlin.)

It is currently in beta, but we will focus on developing the following features, with the goal of providing stable
functionality after the official release.

Features to be implemented:

- A system that can easily handle complex events.
- Create, load, and update configurations in any format such as json, yml, etc..., with simple code.
- Extensions to make it easier to use Bukkit's notation with Kotlin's rich features.
