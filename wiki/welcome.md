# Welcome

FlyLib Reloaded is a utility library that supports plugin development for Minecraft Paper, making it very tedious and buggy to create complex logic for displaying commands and their usage in Paper, and to create menus. FlyLib provides a great solution to this problem.

It is currently in beta, but we will focus on developing the following features, with the goal of providing stable functionality after the official release.

Features to be implemented:
- A system that can easily handle complex events.
- Ability to create, load, and update configurations in any format such as json, yml, etc.
- Extensions to make it easier to use Bukkit's notation with Kotlin's rich features.

If you want to start using this library, check out the following [Getting started](https://github.com/TeamKun/flylib-reloaded/blob/master/wiki/getting-started.md)
